# CDS Assignment 12
Description: 

Python Data and Computations in the book, *Computational Methods for Bioinformatics: Python 3.4, Third Edition by Jason Kinser*.

- [x] Part 1 (`DNA_alignX# Worksheet#.docx` in [Worksheets](Worksheets))
    - Worksheet 1, 2, and 3 exercises for learning module 31 DNA Alignment
- [x] Part 2 ([CDS_HW12.py](CDS_HW12.py) / [CDS230 Assignmnet 12.docx](CDS230 Assignmnet 12.docx))
    - Problems 1 through 5 of Chapter 25 Sequence Alignment.
- [x] Part 3 ([part3-dna-align.py](part3-dna-align.py) / [CDS230 Assignmnet 12.docx](CDS230 Assignmnet 12.docx)))
    - In the Data section of the course website you will find a .zip file titled DNA_Genome.zip with 15 genomes. Choose 1 of the genomes and use the dynamic programming procedure and code modules for sequence alignment that was presented in Chapter 25.6 to perform sequence alignment with 4 of the other sequences. Report the results of the sequence alignments you chose. 

This is an individual assignment and should be your own work. 
Format: Please submit the assignment in pdf or MSWord compatible format. Please show code used and output of the code in your submission.
 
Point value:
